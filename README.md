# Nameless Document Generator
Hello, this is the repository which contains the core contents to generate the nameless documents and tutorials. We are using [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) for the creation and building of the files.

## Submitting Content
Feel free to create a pull request with additional content, once approved it will be added to this repo and shortly after published to the main documentation site.

Please ensure that you have used MkDocs and previewed the site before submitting the pull request to make sure it all looks good and fits in with our current docs.

Also, as a general rule of the thumb, no submitting content to the gh-pages branch. Doing so will result in your pull request being instantly denied. All documentation must be submitted, unbuilt to the master branch.

## Publishing Times
We do not have a set time for publishing content to our website for users to read. However, we aim to get content up and running within a week of it being submitted. Please note that  we are also extremely busy and it can take longer, the time provided above is a rought estimate.
